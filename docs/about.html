I was born and raised in the UK, and moved to Japan in 2016, where I met my wife Keiko. We moved to the UK in 2021, and in 2024 are moving back to Japan<p>This blog is a little project I'm running in my spare time, and is intended to get me writing a little about my experiences, and getting my camera out as much as I can. I hope you enjoy reading it.</section></div></div></div>
