            Hi!

I'm Oscar Scull. I was born and raised in the UK, and moved to
Japan in 2016, where I met my wife Keiko. We moved to the UK in
2021, and in 2024 are moving back to Japan

This blog is a little project I'm running in my spare time, and is
intended to get me writing a little about my experiences, and
getting my camera out as much as I can. I hope you enjoy reading
it.
